## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

QUESTION 1. What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

```{r}
L <- 15 #Lambda value: average events (titi calls) in Poisson distribution.
x <- 1:8 #9 is the minimum number of calls required in the problem.

calls1 <- ppois(q = x, lambda = L) #We calculate the cumulative probability of hearing 1 call, 2 calls, 3 calls... till 8 calls.

1 - calls1

#We calculate the probability of NOT hearing 1 nor 2, nor 3... nor 8 calls. That means the probability of hearing more than 8 calls.

```

QUESTION 2. What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

```{r}

dpois(x = 0, lambda = L) #Probability of hearing no calls (x=0)


```

QUESTION 3. What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

```{r}

dpois(x = 3, lambda = L) #Probability of hearing 3 calls (x=3).

```

QUESTION 4. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

```{r}

x <- c(0:30)

barplot(ppois(q = x, lambda = L), 
  ylim = 0:1, #Interval showed in the "Y" axis.
  space = 0,
  names.arg = x, #Used to label each bar of the plot.
  xlab = "number of calls", 
  ylab = "prob(x)", #Name of axis.
  main = "Mass function in range 0 < x < 30", #Title of the plot.
  col="light blue"
        )
#Bar Plot where it is represented the mass function in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

```

QUESTION 5. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}


```
